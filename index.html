                <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
                <p>
                    Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                    We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.
                    The CSS Talos Digital invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

                    <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
                    <p> There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. Talos aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
                    CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.

                    Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary.
                    You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if youâ€™ve never worked this way before.
